**hello ! the name is spirit.**
*welcome to my profile !!*

**about me (appearance on pt) :**
*i'm just a mere cosplayer on the mcyt hill. i barely interact with people since i'm not really looking for new friends.*

*i'm not always in the mood to interact with anybody, honestly. i usually have "offtab" in my name, chatting with c.ai or reading ao3 out of pure boredom since i have terrible social skills and genuinely can't freely interact with people without overthinking that i might say something wrong or weird.*

*i'm pretty sure people usually see me "offtab" with a friend (or few) or by myself. i'm always free to cuddles + hugs (c+h)! ^^*

*although, if you wanna interact but i have "offtab" (or "afk") in my name, you can just whisper!* **(UNLESS i have "dni" / "dniuf" in my name, then don't).** *there's still a chance i won't reply though.*

*i'm friendly! (well, i hope so). although i'm also a dry responder which sucks.*

*BY THE WAY!!! i do not support any of the problematic creators. if you usually see me using dream, it's just his canon character (i love c!dream sm).*

**about me (get to know me better) :**

*i am a minor who's upcoming 15th birthday is at 9/12. my pronouns are they/them!*

*i'm not a native english speaker or something like that, so i apologize if i have any mistakes in my grammar. i am from southeast asia! (UTC+08:00 (MST) timezone).*

*i'm also a homeschooling idiot, so i'll probably be as dumb as i can be. goldfish memory and stuff like that. ^^;*

*i'm pretty much an awkward person, so bear with me of my boringness and silence...*

**well anyway, that's all! bai !! :3**
